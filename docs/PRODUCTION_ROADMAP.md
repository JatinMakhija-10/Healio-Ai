## **PHASE 1: Critical Medical Accuracy** (Implement NOW)

### 1.1 Symptom Correlation Detection
**Impact:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Fixes naive Bayesian assumption  
**Effort:** Medium (3-5 days)  
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress

```typescript
// Known symptom patterns that are >2x more informative together
const CLINICAL_PATTERNS = {
  bacterial_pneumonia: {
    symptoms: ['fever', 'productive_cough', 'chest_pain'],
    multiplier: 2.5,
    specificity: 0.85
  },
  myocardial_infarction: {
    symptoms: ['chest_pain', 'left_arm_pain', 'sweating', 'nausea'],
    multiplier: 5.0,
    specificity: 0.92
  }
};
```

### 1.2 Clinical Decision Rules Integration
**Impact:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Use validated medical algorithms  
**Effort:** Medium (4-6 days)  
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started

Implement:
- ✅ Wells Score (DVT)
- ✅ PERC Rule (PE)
- ✅ HEART Score (Cardiac)
- ✅ NEXUS Criteria (C-Spine)
- ✅ Ottawa Ankle/Knee Rules

### 1.3 Uncertainty Quantification
**Impact:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Legal liability protection  
**Effort:** Low (2-3 days)  
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started

Show confidence intervals:
```
Diagnosis: Migraine
Confidence: 78% (CI: 65%-87%)
Quality: Moderate uncertainty
Explanation: "Additional symptoms would improve accuracy"
```

## **PHASE 2: Architectural Improvements** (Next Sprint)

### 2.1 Formal State Machine
**Impact:** 🟠 HIGH - Code maintainability  
**Effort:** Medium (3-4 days)

Replace informal loop with proper FSM with state guards.

### 2.2 True Inverted Index
**Impact:** 🟠 HIGH - Performance at scale  
**Effort:** Low (2 days)

Replace "O(40)" with true O(log n) using inverted index + ranking.

### 2.3 Question Cost Analysis
**Impact:** 🟠 HIGH - User experience  
**Effort:** Medium (3 days)

```typescript
score = (informationGain × urgency × clarity) / (askingCost × fatigue)
```

---

## **PHASE 3: Medical Intelligence** (Month 2)

### 3.1 Temporal Reasoning
**Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Accuracy for chronic conditions  
**Effort:** High (7-10 days)

Disease progression analysis:
- Acute vs chronic
- Improving vs worsening
- Episodic patterns

### 3.2 Differential Diagnosis Tree
**Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM - User education  
**Effort:** Medium (5 days)

Visual decision tree showing "if nausea → migraine, else → tension headache"

### 3.3 Advanced Bayesian Network
**Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Theoretical correctness  
**Effort:** Very High (15-20 days)

Full Bayesian Network with conditional dependencies (MCMC sampling).

---

## **PHASE 4: Production Infrastructure** (Month 3)

### 4.1 Care Pathway Generation
**Impact:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Actionability  
**Effort:** Medium (5 days)

For each diagnosis:
- Urgency level
- Next steps with timeline
- Red flags to escalate
- When to follow up

### 4.2 Precomputation & Caching
**Impact:** 🟠 HIGH - Performance  
**Effort:** Medium (4 days)

- Redis cache for common combinations
- Bloom filter for cache checks
- Precompute top 100 symptom sets

### 4.3 Monitoring & Alerting
**Impact:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Production reliability  
**Effort:** Low (3 days)

- Emergency detection SLA monitoring
- Accuracy degradation alerts
- High uncertainty rate tracking

---

## **PHASE 5: Validation** (Month 4)

### 5.1 Clinical Dataset Validation
**Impact:** 🔴 CRITICAL - FDA requirement  
**Effort:** Very High (30+ days)

Test against:
- NIH clinical case studies
- Published case reports
- Synthetic patient scenarios
- Real anonymized EMR data

Target: **>95% accuracy** on validated datasets

### 5.2 Calibration Analysis
**Impact:** 🟠 HIGH - Trust calibration  

Ensure "80% confident" = "80% correct"

### 5.3 Safety Testing
**Impact:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Patient safety  

- Test all emergency patterns against real cases
- False negative rate for life-threatening conditions
- Adversarial testing (edge cases)

## **Implementation Priority (Q1 2026)**

| Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Symptom Correlations | Pattern detection engine |
| 3-4 | Clinical Decision Rules | Wells/PERC/HEART/NEXUS |
| 5 | Uncertainty Quantification | Confidence intervals |
| 6-7 | Care Pathways | Actionable next steps |
| 8 | Testing & Validation | Clinical dataset testing |

## **Metrics to Track**

### Current State
- Emergency detection: 0.50ms ✅
- Test accuracy: 87.5% (8 toy examples) ⚠️
- Confidence calibration: Unknown ❌
- Clinical rule coverage: 0% ❌

### Production Targets
- Emergency detection: <200ms ✅ (already met)
- Validated accuracy: >95% (10,000+ cases)
- Confidence calibration: Within ±5%
- Clinical rule coverage: 50+ validated rules
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5
- False negative rate (emergencies): <0.1%

## **Legal & Compliance**

### FDA Classification
Likely **Class II Medical Device** (requires 510(k) clearance)

### Requirements
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ Version control
- ❌ Clinical validation study
- ❌ Risk analysis (FMEA)
- ❌ Quality management system (ISO 13485)
- ❌ Cybersecurity controls

## **The Brutal Truth**

**Current state:** Impressive demo, not production-ready  
**Gap to production:** 6-12 months engineering + 12-18 months FDA  
**Investment needed:** $500K-$1M (engineering + clinical validation)

**But:** You have a strong foundation. The Bayesian core is solid. The question strategy works. Emergency detection is fast. You're 20% of the way there.

**Next 80%:** Clinical validation, uncertainty quantification, care pathways, and regulatory compliance.

---

## **Immediate Action Items**

1. ✅ Implement symptom correlation detection (this week)
2. ✅ Add clinical decision rules framework (next week)
3. ✅ Deploy uncertainty quantification (next week)
4. ⏳ Partner with medical institution for dataset access
5. ⏳ Consult with FDA regulatory expert
6. ⏳ Set up clinical advisory board

**The goal:** Ship "beta" to select users by end of Q1 with disclaimers, then pursue FDA clearance in Q2-Q4.
